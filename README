Description
-----------

This is my final project for CSCI100 at the College of Wooster. It is a game of Tic-Tac-Toe featuring a two player mode and I am planning on adding a single player mode against the computer.
I used the Tkinter package to handle visualizing the game and detecting user input.


How to Run
----------

To run the game:

1. Make sure Python is installed on your machine

2. Make sure you have the Tkinter package available (if not: http://tkinter.unpythonic.net/wiki/How_to_install_Tkinter)

3. run ticTacToe.py from command line/terminal
	>python ticTacToe.py
